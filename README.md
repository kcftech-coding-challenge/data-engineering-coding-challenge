# Data Engineering Coding Challenge

This is a technical test for data engineering candidates at KCF Technologies, Inc.

## Our Technical Values
We highly value:

* __pragmatic solutions__ with an eye toward future, incremental improvements
* __careful attention__ to detail
* __testing__ before deployment
* __communicating intent__ through code, commits, and documentation

## Challenge

Candidates should do this test on their own. It is designed to be done in 2 or 3 hours but there is no hard limit.

Please see [challenge.PDF](challenge/challenge.pdf) for full instructions and background on the Data Engineering Coding Challenge

## Deliverables
The final output of your work should include:
* The necessary Code and configurations that enable us to run the coding Challenge
* A README that includes:
  * An overview of your solution
  * Instructions for setting up any external dependencies
  * Any additional thoughts or considerations on what you would do differently for production use deployment

**Please do not post your solution on GitHub.**

## Solution Format  
Please do not post your solution to public Git repositories like GitHub or Gitlab. Instead please work locally:

1. `mkdir solution && cd solution`
2. `git init`
3. `touch README.md`
4. `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
5. < ...hack, hack, hack... >

Zip up the project and reply to the email giving you these instructions with the solution attached. There are sometimes issues with our email system filtering out attached zips, we will work with you in that case to find an alternative way to get us the solution.  

## To be improved

We want to get this test better and better. Issues and pull requests are encouraged. This is why this challenge is commited in both TeX and PDF formats.

Happy coding :-)
